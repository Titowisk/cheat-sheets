## Personalizing the IDE
You can customize the window layout to fit your development style. 
You can dock, float or hide any window at any time, and you also can run the editor in full-screen mode. 
You can create and save multiple custom window layouts that show only the windows you need for specific contexts.
For example, you can create a full-screen layout so that all you see is the code editor. And you can create different 
layouts for debugging and for team operations. For more information, see Customizing window layouts.
You can customize Visual Studio in many other ways, and roam your settings if you work on multiple machines.
For more information, see Personalizing the IDE.
There are keyboard shortcuts for almost everything, and you can customize them as well. 
To create new shortcuts, type "Keyboard" in Quick Launch to open the Keyboard dialog box.
From there, you can press F1 to go to the MSDN help page if you need more information about the options. 
For more information, see Default Keyboard Shortcuts in Visual Studio.
